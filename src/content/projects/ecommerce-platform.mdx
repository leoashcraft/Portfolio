## Project Background

This project was for a wholesale distributor who needed more flexibility than traditional e-commerce platforms could offer. Their requirements included tiered B2B pricing, real-time inventory across multiple warehouses, and custom fulfillment logic.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Pricing Engine

The pricing system supports complex rules including:

- Customer-tier based pricing
- Volume discounts with quantity breaks
- Time-limited promotions
- Contract-specific pricing

```php
class PricingEngine
{
    public function calculatePrice(Product $product, Customer $customer, int $qty): Money
    {
        $basePrice = $product->base_price;

        // Apply tier discount
        $tierDiscount = $customer->tier->discount_percentage;
        $price = $basePrice->multiply(1 - $tierDiscount / 100);

        // Apply volume discount
        $volumeBreak = $product->volumeBreaks()
            ->where('min_quantity', '<=', $qty)
            ->orderBy('min_quantity', 'desc')
            ->first();

        if ($volumeBreak) {
            $price = $price->multiply(1 - $volumeBreak->discount / 100);
        }

        // Check for contract pricing
        $contractPrice = $customer->contractPrices()
            ->where('product_id', $product->id)
            ->active()
            ->first();

        if ($contractPrice) {
            return min($price, $contractPrice->price);
        }

        return $price;
    }
}
```

### Real-Time Inventory System

Inventory is tracked across multiple warehouses with:

- WebSocket updates for live stock levels
- Automatic low-stock alerts
- Reserved inventory for pending orders
- Integration with warehouse management systems

### Smart Order Routing

Orders are automatically routed to the optimal fulfillment location based on:

- Proximity to shipping address
- Current stock levels
- Shipping cost optimization
- Carrier availability

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- **Laravel 10** - Application framework
- **MySQL** - Primary database with read replicas
- **Redis** - Session storage, caching, and queues
- **Horizon** - Queue monitoring

### Frontend

- **Vue.js 3** - Reactive UI components
- **Inertia.js** - SPA without API complexity
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

### Infrastructure

- **AWS EC2** - Application servers
- **AWS RDS** - Managed database
- **AWS S3** - Product images and documents
- **CloudFront** - CDN for static assets

## Performance Optimizations

- Database query optimization reduced page load by 65%
- Eager loading eliminated N+1 queries
- Redis caching for product catalog
- Image optimization and lazy loading

## Outcome

The platform successfully launched and now handles over $2M in monthly transactions. The client was able to onboard new B2B customers faster and reduce fulfillment errors significantly.
