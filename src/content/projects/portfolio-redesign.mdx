problem: "My previous Laravel-based portfolio was functional but lacked the visual impact and interactivity that modern web development can offer. I wanted something that would immediately capture attention and showcase my technical capabilities."
solution: "Built a completely new portfolio from the ground up using Astro for its excellent performance and SEO capabilities, combined with Three.js for 3D graphics and GSAP for smooth animations."

## The Challenge

As a full-stack developer with over 15 years of experience, I needed a portfolio that would not only showcase my work but also demonstrate my ability to work with cutting-edge web technologies. The previous Laravel-based site served its purpose well, but it was time for something more dynamic.

## Technical Approach

### Framework Selection

I chose **Astro** as the foundation for several reasons:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only ships JS where needed
- **Partial hydration** - React components only load when visible
- **Built-in SEO** - Server-rendered pages with full meta control
- **MDX support** - Content management without a CMS

### 3D Graphics Implementation

The hero section features a custom Three.js scene built with React Three Fiber:

```typescript
function CodeParticles() {
  const mesh = useRef<THREE.InstancedMesh>(null);
  const count = 150;

  useFrame(({ clock }) => {
    if (!mesh.current) return;
    particles.forEach((particle, i) => {
      // Animate each particle with unique motion
      const t = clock.elapsedTime + particle.offset;
      dummy.position.set(
        particle.x + Math.sin(t * particle.speed) * 0.5,
        particle.y + Math.cos(t * particle.speed) * 0.3,
        particle.z
      );
      dummy.updateMatrix();
      mesh.current!.setMatrixAt(i, dummy.matrix);
    });
    mesh.current.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;
  });
}
```

### Interactive Terminal

The terminal component simulates a real command-line interface with:

- Command history (arrow keys)
- Tab completion
- Multiple themed commands
- ASCII art Easter eggs

## Results

The new portfolio achieves excellent performance scores while delivering a memorable user experience. The combination of server-side rendering and client-side hydration ensures fast initial loads without sacrificing interactivity.

## Key Learnings

1. **Three.js bundle size** requires careful optimization - lazy loading is essential
2. **Astro's island architecture** is perfect for mixing static and interactive content
3. **Accessibility** must be built in from the start, especially with 3D content
