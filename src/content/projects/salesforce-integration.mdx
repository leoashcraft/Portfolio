## Project Overview

This enterprise-level integration project involved creating a robust middleware platform to connect Salesforce CRM with multiple internal business systems. The goal was to eliminate manual data entry and ensure data consistency across all platforms.

## Technical Architecture

### System Design

The platform uses an event-driven architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway** - Laravel-based REST API handling all external requests
- **Message Queue** - Redis-backed queue for processing Salesforce webhooks
- **Sync Engine** - Custom service managing bidirectional data flow
- **Conflict Resolver** - Handles data conflicts with configurable rules

### Salesforce Integration

We leveraged the Salesforce REST and Bulk APIs for different use cases:

```php
class SalesforceService
{
    public function syncContact(Contact $contact): void
    {
        $sfClient = $this->getAuthenticatedClient();

        $existing = $sfClient->find('Contact', [
            'Email' => $contact->email
        ]);

        if ($existing) {
            $sfClient->update('Contact', $existing->Id, [
                'FirstName' => $contact->first_name,
                'LastName' => $contact->last_name,
                'Phone' => $contact->phone,
                'Custom_Field__c' => $contact->custom_data,
            ]);
        } else {
            $sfClient->create('Contact', $contact->toSalesforceArray());
        }
    }
}
```

### Error Handling & Monitoring

The platform includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Real-time sync status dashboard
- Automated retry logic for failed syncs
- Email/Slack alerts for critical failures
- Detailed audit logging for compliance

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: API Rate Limits

Salesforce imposes strict API limits. We solved this with:

- Request batching for bulk operations
- Intelligent caching to reduce redundant calls
- Priority queue for time-sensitive syncs

### Challenge: Data Conflicts

When the same record is modified in both systems simultaneously:

1. Timestamp comparison to determine newest
2. Field-level conflict resolution
3. Manual review queue for complex conflicts

## Impact

The platform now processes over 10,000 records daily with 99.9% uptime. Sales team productivity increased significantly, and data quality improved dramatically across all systems.
