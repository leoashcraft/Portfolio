          <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            After years of deliberately avoiding AI-assisted coding out of fear of dulling my own skills, Anthropic's Claude Code has slowly crept into my workflow. I finally gave in - cautiously - and it's been a net positive. I mostly use it for wireframing ideas and quickly diagnosing issues like mismatched arrays or malformed JSON. Full-on "vibe coding" is still discouraged (for me), but the power is undeniable - and ignoring it entirely feels riskier than learning to use it well.

            I genuinely love the work I do at Parker University and the people I work with on the marketing team. My favorite project has been integrating <a href="https://www.searchstax.com" class="external-link text-neon-cyan hover:text-neon-pink transition-colors" data-external-url="https://www.searchstax.com">SearchStax</a> into the site, building modal-based, asynchronous instant search for a smoother user experience. A close second is the <a href="https://parker.edu/pathways" class="external-link text-neon-cyan hover:text-neon-pink transition-colors" data-external-url="https://parker.edu/pathways">Career Pathways</a> application, which helps prospective students explore where their education can take them. Third - and arguably most impactful - is the <a href="https://parker.edu/application" class="external-link text-neon-cyan hover:text-neon-pink transition-colors" data-external-url="https://parker.edu/application">Parker Student Application</a>, which integrates Salesforce Communities directly into the site and has significantly improved both user experience and enrollment numbers.

              Despite a busy year, I managed to build a chicken run using a greenhouse frame connected to an insulated metal building. I added an Omlet automatic door (chosen specifically for its exposed API, which I still haven't explored). Seasonal tweaks include dark plastic roofing for winter heat absorption and a white tarp in summer to reflect sunlight. We now have a dozen chickens, including one rooster.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also nearly finished insulating my daughter's playhouse, and I've had a great time designing and building a solar power system: 24V, 1180W of 25% high-efficiency panels, and a 200Ah LiFePO4 battery. I'm already eyeing a battery upgrade - ideally doubling or tripling capacity. Eventually, this system will power the playhouse along with fans and lighting for the chicken coop.
